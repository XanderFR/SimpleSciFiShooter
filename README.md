# SimpleSciFiShooter
My first mini video game project made with the Unreal Engine and C++. It is a 3-level, third-person shooter game where the player has to defeat all of the enemies across all three levels in order to win. Defeating all of the enemies in a given level allows the player to move on to the next one while losing lets the player restart in the level they were defeated in. The game features: basic shooting mechanics, a simple HUD with a health bar, animated player & enemy characters, level switching and simple AI that makes the enemies pursue and shoot at the player, and makes them go back to their original location if they can't find the player.

Please note that this repository only has the files from the project's Source directory.
